       AUTOMATE BIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT


## **Bit Cloud Deployment**

### **Best Practices**
- Break components into modular units for reusability.
- Automate exporting components with CI/CD pipelines.

#### **Steps to Deploy**:
1. Initialize Bit:
   ```bash
   npm install bit-bin -g
   bit init
   ```

2. Export React.js components:
   ```bash
   bit add src/components/* --main src/components/index.js
   bit tag --all 1.0.0
   bit export username.collection
   ```

3. Automate exports with GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   name: Bit Export

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     export:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Export components
           run: |
             bit install
             bit export
   ```
